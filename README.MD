# Event-driven taxonomy (EDT) based non-target analysis tool

An Integrated Tool for Text Mining, High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry Analysis, and Deep Learning Applications

## Introduction

This project offers a comprehensive solution that integrates text mining, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis, and deep learning techniques. The repository is structured into three main folders:

1. **TM (Text Mining)**: This module focuses on extracting valuable information from textual data using advanced text mining methodologies.
2. **EDMS (Enhanced Deep Mass Spectrometry)**: This module utilizes deep learning to develop methods for identifying ions in HRMS data.
3. **EDT-Screening**: This module is dedicated to building a screening mass spectrometry library for efficient data analysis.

## Features

- **Text Mining (TM)**:
  - Advanced text processing and feature extraction.
  - Keyword analysis and semantic mapping.
  - Integration with external databases for enriched data retrieval.

- **Enhanced Deep Mass Spectrometry (EDMS)**:
  - Deep learning models for ion identification in HRMS.
  - Support for custom model training and optimization.
  - High accuracy and efficiency in spectral analysis.

- **EDT-Screening**:
  - Construction of comprehensive mass spectrometry libraries.
  - Tools for data normalization and standardization.
  - Fast and accurate screening algorithms.
