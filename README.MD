# Event-driven taxonomy (EDT) based non-target analysis tool

An Integrated Tool for Text Mining, Deep Learning for Structures Predictions and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry Applications

## Introduction

The repository is structured into three main folders:

1. **TM (Text Mining)**: This module focuses on extracting valuable information from textual data using advanced text mining methodologies.
2. **EDMS (Enhanced Deep Mass Spectrometry)**: This module utilizes deep learning to develop methods for identifying ions in HRMS data.
3. **EDT-Screening**: This module is dedicated to building a screening mass spectrometry library for efficient data analysis.

## Features

- **Text Mining (TM)**:
  - Data sources query and literature scrapy.
  - Advanced text processing and feature extraction.
  - Keyword analysis and semantic mapping.
  - Integration with external databases for enriched data retrieval.

- **Enhanced Deep Mass Spectrometry (EDMS)**:
  - The ANN models for predicting the bioactive substructures (EDFP).
  - The CCNN models for predicting the ions (EDION) based on the EDFPs.
  - Support for custom model training and optimization.
  - The data prepartion and oepn access library decoding.

- **EDT-Screening**:
  - Construction of comprehensive mass spectrometry libraries based on TM and EDMS.
  - Substructures annotation.
